This is my attempt to re-teach myself data structures after falling asleep at 50% of my lectures at Queens College.  
You can lectures and course information [here](http://datastructur.es/sp16/)
I'm also using this wonderfully curated [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPcncwcN2UkazPbL42D-RiJL7Q_Kc9zWx)
