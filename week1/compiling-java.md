# Compiling Java

Here's a brief refresher on compiling java programs.  

When you're dealing with a text editor (like VIM ðŸ˜‰), you can compile your java code from the terminal.  
All you have to do is run the `javac` command with your filename to compile it.  
Assuming you can a file called `Hello.java`, you would compile it with `javac Hello.java` 

Your Java code is them compiled into bytecode, which can be distributed to others and run with the `java` command.  

You would then run the file by typing `java Hello` in your terminal.
