## Java and Object Orientation

This won't really be a resource to learning Java. Rather, it's how to implement data structures and algorithms in Java.

Since I know enough Java I'm going to be skipping hw0  
This is mainly for the purpose of getting this done in a short amount of time before I come back and refine everything  

Just remember some key things like...  
- Don't repeat yourself
- Don't code like shit
- Make your code readable
- Java is a statically typed language.


- Every java file contains a class declaration unless it's an interface
- All the code (unless again, you're dealing with interfaces) lives inside a class
- A Java program is run from the main method defined like so:
	- ```java public static void main(String[] args){ ... }```
